# About Kotlin

1. !! Not-null assertion operator converts any value to a non-null type.
2. Single expression functions are without return and curly braces.
3. Class is a blueprint and object is the implementation of blueprint.
4. Object class can't be instantiated or have a constructor.
5. Primary constructor can have type declaration to access data member inside functions, but secondary constructor.
6. Primary constructor, init block and secondary constructor are executed in same order.
7. Data classes are useful for destructuring and holding similar data efficiently. Data class primary constructor must have only property (val / var) parameters.
8. To inherit a class, override its member function or data member; each needs to be declared as open.
9. Base class can be instantiated, but abstract class or interface. 
10. Pair is a collection of 2 variables and Triple is a collection of 3 variables.
11. lateinit modifier is used with var data type. It can change values as per proper execution. It does not work with nullable types.
12. lazy can be initialized only once; so it is used with val data type.
13. Enumerated class contains set of constant values. Each constant enum is itself an object.
14. Scope Functions are functions which execute a block of code in context of an object. Scope Functions create temporary scope inside which you access the object as it or this.
    * 'it' refers to object in case of ***let*** scope function. It returns the result. It's used to access the result of call chains. It can also be used to for null check on objects of nullable type using safe call operator.
    * 'this' refers to object inside ***run*** scope function.It also returns the result. This is used when we need to initialize an object and perform some operation on it.
    * 'this' refers to object inside ***apply*** scope function. It's used to initialize an object and return the same object.
    * 'it' refers to object inside ***also*** scope function. It is used to perform some side operation like logging or debugging.
    * ***let*** and ***run*** scope functions transform the object, but ***apply*** and ***also*** doesn't.
15. Generics are the powerful features that allow us to define classes, methods and properties which are accessible using different data types while keeping a check of the compile-time type safety.
    * We always use angle brackets <> to specify the type parameter. 
    * Advantages of generic â€“
      * *Type casting is evitable*- No need to typecast the object. 
      * *Type safety*- Generic allows only single type of object at a time.
      * *Compile time safety*- Generics code is checked at compile time for the parameterized type so that it avoids run time error. 
    * Generic types are invariant in Kotlin. Invariance is the property by which a standard generic function/class already defined for a particular data type, cannot accept or return another datatype.
    * Variance is of two types-
       * Declaration-site variance(using in and out)
        * we can use the out keyword on the generic type which means we can assign this reference to any of its supertypes. The out value can only be produced by the given class but can not be consumed.
        * we can use the in keyword on the generic type which means we can assign this reference to any of its subtypes. The in keyword can be used only on the parameter type that is consumed, not produced.
        * *Covariance* implies substituting subtype is acceptable, but supertype is not, i.e. the generic function/class may accept subtypes of the datatype it is already defined for, e.g. a generic class defined for Number can accept Int, but a generic class defined for Int cannot accept Number.
        * *Contravariance* is used to substitute a supertype value in the subtypes, i.e. the generic function/class may accept supertypes of the datatype it is already defined for, e.g. a generic class defined for Number cannot accept Int, but a generic class defined for Int can accept Number.  
      * Use-site variance: Type and star projection
        * Type Projection: If we want to copy all the elements of an array of some type into the array of Any type then it can be possible, but to allow the compiler to compile our code we need to annotate the input parameter with the out keyword. This makes the compiler to infer that input argument can be of any type that is a subtype of the Any.
        * Star Projection: When we do not know about the specific type of the value, and we just want to print all the elements of an array then we use star(*) projection.
16. A function which can accept a function as parameter or can return a function is called *Higher-Order function*.
17. With extensions, we can add more functionality to the existing classes, without inheriting them. When a function is added to an existing class it is known as Extension Function.
    * They are resolved statically i.e. which extension function is executed depends totally on the type of the expression on which it is invoked, rather than on the type resolved on the final execution of the expression at runtime.
    * Extension functions can also be defined with the class type that is nullable.
