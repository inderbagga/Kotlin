### Generics are the powerful features that allow us to define classes, methods and properties which are accessible using different data types while keeping a check of the compile-time type safety.

    * We always use angle brackets <> to specify the type parameter.

    * Advantages of generic â€“
      * Type casting is evitable- No need to typecast the object.
      * Type safety- Generic allows only single type of object at a time.
      * Compile time safety- Generics code is checked at compile time for the parameterized type so that it avoids run time error.

    * Generic types are invariant in Kotlin.

    * Invariance is the property by which a standard generic function/class already defined for a particular data type, cannot accept or return another datatype.
