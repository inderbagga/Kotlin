### Backing fields

* In Kotlin, a field is only used as a part of a property to hold its value in memory.
* Fields can not be declared directly. However, when a property needs a backing field, Kotlin provides it automatically.
* Backing field is an autogenerated field for any property which can only be used inside the accessors(getter or setter).
* It will be present only if it uses the default implementation of at least one of the accessors, or if a custom accessor references it through the field identifier.
* This backing field is used to avoid the recursive call of an accessor which ultimately prevents the StackOverflowError.

 For these purposes, Kotlin provides an automatic backing field which can be accessed using the field identifier.
